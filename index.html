    <h2><a id="Hello_World">Hello World! I'm Denise Montano.</a></h2>
    <p>I am currently a Student at Thinkful from Philadelphia, PA. I'm expected to complete February 2021 and begin a career in front-end web development.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>As this is just the beginning, I'm still discovering everything that is availible. I do have a few ideas of what I want to do after Thinkful: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Create streamlined platforms to ease the customer service workflow for companies</li>
      <li>Help my friends create attractive websites for their budding businesses</li>
      <li>Expand into freelance work</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="box about-me">
    <h2><a id="About_Me">About Me</a></h2>

    <p>I've attended Hampton University as an Engineering student and went to Penn State Universty for Journalism. I was scared of the former major and uninterested in the latter. </p>

    <p>After school, I worked in Customer Service for awhile and became a mother to a beautiful boy. I still was not satisfied.</p>
    
    <p>I realized I did some web development as a Print Journalism Major and also I enjoyed spending hours creating the best MySpace page. The move to coding almost seemed organic.</p>

    <p> After a push from a friend, I began Thinkful and now I love it. I look forward to the beautiful and innovative webpages to come.</p>
